## Overview

Atrarium uses **17 predefined moderation reasons** to ensure privacy protection and consistency. Each reason is a short code (e.g., `spam`) that maps to human-readable labels in English and Japanese.

**Key Principle**: All moderation actions are PUBLIC records stored in moderators' Personal Data Servers (PDS). Using enum values instead of free-text prevents accidental leakage of personal information (emails, phone numbers, internal reports).

---

## Why Enum-Only? (No Free-Text)

### The Problem with Free-Text Reasons

**AT Protocol Context**:
- All PDS records are **PUBLIC** (anyone can read them)
- Private/encrypted data support is planned for 2025 but **not yet available**
- Moderators may accidentally include PII in free-text fields

**Real-World Risk Examples**:

| Free-Text Input (❌ DANGEROUS) | Privacy Issue |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| `"Removed based on report from user@example.com"` | Email address exposed |
| `"User John Doe violated policy (ticket #12345)"` | Name + internal ticket ID exposed |
| `"Contact +1-555-123-4567 for details"` | Phone number exposed |
| `"Alice complained about this in private DM"` | Reporter identity exposed |
| `"See internal Slack thread for context"` | Confidential communication reference |

**Regex Validation Limitations** (Previous Approach):
- 83 lines of complex regex patterns
- Could detect emails, phones, URLs, keywords
- **Could NOT catch**: "User John Doe reported this" (no regex can catch all PII patterns)
- Performance cost: 10-20ms per validation

### The Enum Solution

**How It Works**:
1. Moderator selects from dropdown (e.g., "Spam post" / "スパム投稿")
2. System stores enum value: `"spam"` (not the human-readable label)
3. **No free-text input possible** → Zero privacy risk
4. Validation: Simple array membership check (<1ms)

**Benefits**:

| Aspect | Free-Text (Before) | Enum (After) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Privacy Risk | Medium (regex can't catch all PII) | **Zero** (no input possible) |
| Validation Complexity | 83 lines of regex | 10 lines of enum check |
| Performance | 10-20ms | <1ms |
| Consistency | Varies by moderator | Standardized |
| i18n Support | Not implemented | Fully localized (EN/JA) |
| Statistical Analysis | Difficult (inconsistent wording) | Easy (predefined categories) |

**What About Detailed Notes?**

Moderators use **external systems** for internal context:

```
✅ Public PDS Record (Safe):
{
  "reason": "spam",
  "target": "at://did:plc:bob123/app.bsky.feed.post/3jzfcijpj2z2a"
}

✅ Private Discord Message (Internal):
"Post at://did:plc:bob123/app.bsky.feed.post/3jzfcijpj2z2a
hidden for spam - related to ticket #12345, reported by Alice"
```

This separation ensures:
- Public records contain only safe enum values
- Internal details stay in private channels (Discord, internal tools)
- Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

## Reason Catalog

### Category 1: Spam / Low Quality

**Severity**: Medium (annoying but not harmful)

**Moderator Action**: Hide post, warn user on first offense

---

#### 2. `low_quality` (低品質コンテンツ / Low-quality content)

**Purpose**: Content that adds no value to the community discussion

**When to Use**:
- Single-word posts ("lol", "w", "nice")

**Examples**:
- ✅ Post containing only "w w w w w"

- ❌ Spam with commercial intent → Use `spam`

**Severity**: Low (more of a quality standard issue)

**Moderator Action**: Hide post, educate user on community standards

**Moderator Note**: Be careful not to discourage genuine new users. Consider context before using this reason.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "What's your favorite anime?" posted 3 times in same day
- ✅ User asks same question already answered in pinned FAQ
- ✅ Network error causes double submission
- ❌ Different discussion on same topic → Not duplicate
- ❌ Intentional spam reposting → Use `spam`

**Severity**: Varies (depends on actual violation)

**Moderator Action**: Document thoroughly in external system, consider if new enum value is needed

**Moderator Note**: If you use `other` frequently for same type of violation, propose new enum value to development team.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### For Moderators

**1. Be Specific**
- Use the most specific reason that applies
- `spam` is better than `other` for advertising
- `wrong_community` is better than `off_topic` when suggesting alternative

**2. Combine with External Notes**
When detailed context is needed:
```
✅ Public PDS: reason = "harassment"
✅ Discord: "Harassment of Alice by Bob (third offense), previous incidents:
  - 2025-09-15: Insulted Alice in #general
  - 2025-09-20: Posted Alice's old photos without consent
  - 2025-10-05: Sent threatening DM (screenshot attached)"
```

**3. Consistency**
- Use same reason for similar violations
- Enables statistical analysis
- Fair moderation (users know what to expect)

**4. Documentation**
- Always log reason in moderation action
- Add detailed notes to external system (Discord, Notion, etc.)
- Include:
  - Specific guideline/rule violated
  - Context (if not obvious)
  - Related tickets/reports
  - Previous warnings

**5. Education Over Punishment**
- First offense: Hide + educate
- Second offense: Hide + warning
- Third offense: Temporary ban
- Use `other` + context for genuine edge cases

### For Developers

**Adding New Reasons**:

```typescript
// Step 1: Add to enum array (append, don't reorder)
export const MODERATION_REASONS = [
  // ... existing 17 values
  'misinformation', // NEW
] as const;

// Step 2: Add to Lexicon schema
// specs/007-reason-enum-atproto/contracts/lexicon/net.atrarium.moderation.action.json
{
  "reason": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": [
      // ... existing values
      "misinformation"
    ]
  }
}

// Step 3: Add i18n labels
// dashboard/src/i18n/locales/en/moderation.json
{
  "reasons": {
    "misinformation": "Misinformation or fake news"
  }
}

// dashboard/src/i18n/locales/ja/moderation.json
{
  "reasons": {
    "misinformation": "誤情報または虚偽ニュース"
  }
}

// Step 4: Update this document
// Add new reason to appropriate category with full details
```

## Statistical Analysis

### Tracking Community Health

**Spam Ratio**:
```
spam_ratio = (spam + low_quality + duplicate) / total_posts
Healthy: < 5%
Warning: 5-10%
Critical: > 10%
```

**Safety Score**:
```
safety_violations = harassment + hate_speech + violence + illegal_content
Safety Score = 100 - (safety_violations / total_posts * 100)
Healthy: > 99%
Warning: 95-99%
Critical: < 95%
```

**Content Fit**:
```
misfit_ratio = (off_topic + wrong_community) / total_posts
Healthy: < 10%
Warning: 10-20%
Critical: > 20% (indicates unclear community purpose)
```

### Moderation Trends

**Example Query** (hypothetical):
```sql
SELECT
  reason,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as percentage
FROM moderation_actions
WHERE community_id = 'anime-community'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY reason
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Expected Distribution** (healthy community):
```
spam:              40%  (most common)
low_quality:       25%
off_topic:         15%
guidelines:        10%
other:             10%
harassment:         0-1%  (rare in healthy community)
hate_speech:        0%    (should be near-zero)
```

---

## Adding New Reasons

### Decision Criteria

**Add New Reason If**:
- ✅ Used `other` 10+ times for same violation type
- ✅ Represents distinct moderation policy
- ✅ Enables better statistical analysis
- ✅ Common across multiple communities (not one-off)

**Don't Add If**:
- ❌ Very rare edge case (< 1% of all moderation)
- ❌ Community-specific quirk
- ❌ Covered by existing reason + external notes
- ❌ Would create confusion with existing reasons

### Process

1. **Proposal**: Create GitHub issue with:
   - Reason name (lowercase_snake_case)
   - EN/JA labels
   - Category
   - Use cases (5+ examples)
   - Why existing reasons insufficient

2. **Discussion**: Community moderators vote (need 60% approval)

3. **Implementation**: Follow developer steps above

4. **Migration**: Announce to moderators, update training materials
