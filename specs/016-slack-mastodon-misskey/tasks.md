## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- **TDD critical**: T008-T015 MUST fail before T016-T021 implementation starts (COMPLETED)
- **Constitution Principle 8 & 10 Compliance**: All persistent storage uses PDS + Lexicon (no separate databases), features fully implemented (no "MVP" deferrals)
  - ‚úÖ Reactions: `net.atrarium.community.reaction` records in user PDSs (Lexicon schema in contracts/)
  - ‚úÖ Custom emojis: `net.atrarium.community.emoji` records + PDS blob storage (Lexicon schema in contracts/)
  - ‚úÖ Aggregates: Durable Objects Storage (7-day cache, rebuildable from PDS)
  - ‚úÖ Rate limiting: Durable Objects ephemeral storage (1-hour sliding window)
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task completion (atomic changes), pre-commit hooks validate all changes
- **Schema migration**: NEW Lexicon schemas in contracts/ must be moved to lexicons/ for production (T051-T053)
- **SSE implementation**: Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (T043-T046), fallback to TanStack Query polling
- **Rate limiting**: 100 reactions/hour/user (T047-T048), 429 response with Retry-After header
- **Emoji validation**: Multi-stage (client + server), 256KB max, 64px√ó512px max, 8:1 aspect ratio (T049-T050)
- **Modal overflow**: 20 emoji types inline, "Show More" button for additional (T054-T055, FR-029/FR-033 compliance)

---
