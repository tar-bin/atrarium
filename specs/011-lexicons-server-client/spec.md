# Feature Specification: Reorganize Implementation into Lexicons, Server, and Client

**Feature Branch**: `011-lexicons-server-client`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ÂÆüË£ÖÈÉ®ÂàÜ„Çílexicons, server, client „Å®„Åô„Çã"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature requires reorganizing project structure
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, maintainers
   ‚Üí Actions: Restructure codebase, separate concerns
   ‚Üí Data: Lexicon schemas, server code, client code
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must maintain existing functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Scope of "client" - does this include dashboard only, or docs as well?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Migration strategy - should this be gradual or all-at-once?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Build system changes - how should build processes be updated?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: Developer navigates new structure
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Lexicons, Server, Client directories
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on Atrarium, I want the codebase to be organized into clear logical components (lexicons, server, client) so that I can:
- Quickly locate relevant code for each implementation layer
- Understand the separation of concerns between protocol definition, backend logic, and frontend UI
- Work on one component without accidentally affecting others
- Onboard new contributors more easily with a clearer project structure

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to modify a Lexicon schema, **When** they navigate the repository, **Then** they can find all schema files in a dedicated directory without searching through implementation code
2. **Given** a developer needs to work on backend API logic, **When** they access the server directory, **Then** they can see all server-side code isolated from client code
3. **Given** a developer needs to update the frontend UI, **When** they access the client directory, **Then** they can work on client code without encountering server logic
4. **Given** the repository is reorganized, **When** CI/CD pipelines run, **Then** all existing tests pass without modification
5. **Given** the repository is reorganized, **When** deployment occurs, **Then** the application functions identically to before the reorganization

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a file needs to be shared between server and client (e.g., type definitions)?
- How does the system handle build artifacts in the new structure?
- What if a developer checks out an old branch after the reorganization?
- How are imports updated when files move locations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST organize all AT Protocol Lexicon schema files (`net.atrarium.*`) into a dedicated lexicons directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize all backend/server implementation code into a dedicated server directory
- **FR-003**: System MUST organize all frontend/client implementation code into a dedicated client directory
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality after reorganization (no breaking changes)
- **FR-005**: System MUST update all import paths and references to reflect new file locations
- **FR-006**: System MUST update build configurations to work with the new directory structure
- **FR-007**: System MUST update test configurations to locate test files in the new structure
- **FR-008**: System MUST update documentation to reflect the new directory organization
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: client scope not specified - include dashboard only, or both dashboard and docs?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: shared code location not specified - where should types/utilities used by both server and client reside?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: configuration file organization not specified - should wrangler.toml, package.json remain at root or move with server?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Lexicons Directory**: Contains all AT Protocol Lexicon JSON schema files that define the protocol contract (currently in `lexicons/`)
- **Server Directory**: Contains all backend implementation code including Workers, Durable Objects, routes, services, and server-side types
- **Client Directory**: Contains all frontend implementation code including dashboard components, UI, and client-side logic
- **Shared/Common Code**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Location and organization of code shared between server and client not specified]
