**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "API„ÇíoRPC„Å®„Åó„Å¶ÂÆåÂÖ®„Å´ÂÆüË£Ö„Åô„Çã"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Migrate all legacy Hono routes to oRPC router implementation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: API developers, client developers
   ‚Üí Actions: Migrate Posts/Emoji/Reactions routes, fix Moderation.list
   ‚Üí Data: Posts, Emojis, Reactions, Moderation actions
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must maintain API contract compatibility, preserve PDS-first architecture
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects are clear from codebase analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow: migrate routes, test compatibility, deprecate legacy
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable via contract tests
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Posts, Emojis, Reactions, Moderation Actions (already defined in Lexicon schemas)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details (focuses on API contract, not specific tech)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an **API client developer**, I want to use a **type-safe, unified oRPC interface** for all Atrarium API endpoints, so that I can **benefit from compile-time type checking, automatic code completion, and consistent error handling** across all API operations (communities, memberships, posts, emoji, reactions, moderation).

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an API client uses the oRPC contract for Posts API, **When** they call `posts.create()`, **Then** they receive compile-time type safety for inputs/outputs and the post is created in the user's PDS.

2. **Given** an API client uses the oRPC contract for Emoji API, **When** they call `emoji.upload()`, **Then** TypeScript validates the emoji format at compile time and the emoji record is stored in the user's PDS.

3. **Given** an API client uses the oRPC contract for Reactions API, **When** they call `reactions.add()`, **Then** the reaction is recorded in PDS and aggregated in the Durable Object without type mismatches.

4. **Given** an API client uses the oRPC contract for Moderation API, **When** they call `moderation.list()` with a community URI, **Then** they receive all moderation actions for that community (not an empty array).

5. **Given** existing API clients use legacy Hono routes, **When** routes are migrated to oRPC, **Then** API behavior remains identical (backward compatibility guaranteed).

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a client tries to call a legacy route after migration?
  ‚Üí Legacy routes should be deprecated with clear migration path, but temporarily maintained for backward compatibility during transition period.

- How does the system handle validation errors in oRPC vs legacy routes?
  ‚Üí Both should return identical error structures (status codes, error messages) to maintain compatibility.

- What happens if oRPC middleware fails to extract user context?
  ‚Üí Authenticated endpoints should return 401 Unauthorized, public endpoints should proceed without user context.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Posts API (oRPC Migration)
- **FR-001**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for creating posts in community feeds via PDS records.
- **FR-002**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for listing posts in a community feed with pagination.
- **FR-003**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for retrieving individual post details by URI.
- **FR-004**: Posts API MUST enforce membership validation (only community members can post).
- **FR-005**: Posts API MUST support custom Lexicon schema (`net.atrarium.community.post`) storage in user PDS.

#### Emoji API (oRPC Migration)
- **FR-006**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for uploading custom emojis to user PDS.
- **FR-007**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for listing user's uploaded emojis.
- **FR-008**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for submitting emojis to community registry (approval required).
- **FR-009**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for listing pending emoji submissions (admin-only).
- **FR-010**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for approving emoji submissions (owner-only).
- **FR-011**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for revoking approved emojis (owner-only).
- **FR-012**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for retrieving community emoji registry (public).

#### Reactions API (oRPC Migration)
- **FR-013**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for adding reactions to posts (Unicode or custom emoji).
- **FR-014**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for removing user's own reactions.
- **FR-015**: API MUST provide oRPC endpoints for listing reaction aggregates for a post.
- **FR-016**: Reactions API MUST enforce rate limiting (100 reactions/hour/user).
- **FR-017**: Reactions API MUST support real-time reaction updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

#### Moderation API (Fix)
- **FR-018**: Moderation list endpoint MUST accept `communityUri` parameter to filter actions by community.
- **FR-019**: Moderation list endpoint MUST return all moderation actions for communities where user has admin permissions.

#### Type Safety & Developer Experience
- **FR-020**: API MUST provide end-to-end type safety from server to client via oRPC contract.
- **FR-021**: API MUST generate OpenAPI specification from oRPC contract for documentation.
- **FR-022**: API MUST validate inputs/outputs against Zod schemas at runtime.
- **FR-023**: API MUST return consistent error structures across all endpoints (oRPC standard errors).

#### Backward Compatibility
- **FR-024**: API MUST maintain identical response formats during migration (no breaking changes).
- **FR-025**: API MUST support legacy routes during transition period with deprecation warnings.
- **FR-026**: API MUST document migration path from legacy routes to oRPC in API documentation.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Post**: Community post content stored in user PDS via `net.atrarium.community.post` Lexicon. Attributes: text, communityId, createdAt.
- **Emoji**: Custom emoji image/metadata stored in user PDS. Attributes: shortcode, imageUrl, creator, approved (community-level).
- **Reaction**: User reaction to a post (emoji reference + post URI). Stored in PDS as `net.atrarium.community.reaction`. Aggregated in Durable Object for performance.
- **Moderation Action**: Admin action against post/user. Stored in moderator's PDS as `net.atrarium.moderation.action`. Attributes: action type, target, reason, timestamp.

## Notes

### Scope Boundaries
- **In scope**: Migrating Posts, Emoji, Reactions routes to oRPC; fixing Moderation.list
- **Out of scope**: Changing API contract definitions (already defined in `shared/contracts/src/router.ts`)
- **Out of scope**: Modifying Lexicon schemas (already stable)

### Dependencies
- Existing oRPC contract definitions in `@atrarium/contracts`
- Existing PDS service methods in `server/src/services/atproto.ts`
- Existing Durable Object implementations for Posts/Emoji/Reactions

### Assumptions
- Current API contract in `shared/contracts/src/router.ts` is correct and complete
- Legacy Hono routes have identical behavior to what oRPC should implement
- Client migration can happen incrementally (legacy routes maintained temporarily)

### Success Metrics
- All contract endpoints have working handlers in `server/src/router.ts`
- Contract tests pass for all migrated endpoints
- OpenAPI spec includes all endpoints
- No regressions in existing API behavior (integration tests pass)
