# Feature Specification: Internal Post Management (Decouple from Bluesky Posts)

**Feature Branch**: `014-bluesky`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Specification Complete
**Input**: User description: "ÊäïÁ®ø„ÅØ„Çø„Ç§„É†„É©„Ç§„É≥„Åî„Å®„Å´ÂÜÖÈÉ®„ÅßÁã¨Ëá™ÁÆ°ÁêÜ„Åô„Çã„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´„Åó„ÄÅBluesky„ÅÆÊäïÁ®ø„ÇíÂà©Áî®„Åô„Çã„ÅÆ„Çí„ÇÑ„ÇÅ„Çã"
**Clarification**: User selected **Interpretation A** - Define custom Lexicon for post data, store in PDS, stop using Bluesky Firehose

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature request: Stop using Bluesky posts, manage posts internally per timeline
   ‚Üí Clarified: Use custom Lexicon schemas, store in PDS (Interpretation A)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Community members, moderators, system
   ‚Üí Actions: Create posts, read timeline, store posts internally in PDS
   ‚Üí Data: Post content, metadata, timeline association via Lexicon
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use AT Protocol + PDS + custom Lexicon schemas
3. Ambiguities resolved:
   ‚Üí Posts stored in PDS using new net.atrarium.community.post Lexicon
   ‚Üí Stop indexing from Bluesky Firehose (app.bsky.feed.post)
   ‚Üí Posts visible only in Atrarium dashboard (not official Bluesky apps)
   ‚Üí Maintains Constitution compliance (Principles 4, 5, 8)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: User creates post in community timeline using custom Lexicon
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Custom Lexicon definition, PDS storage, direct querying (no Firehose)
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Post (net.atrarium.community.post), Timeline, Author
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí PASS: Constitution compliant, requirements clear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a community member, I want to create posts that appear only in my community timeline without requiring them to be published to the broader Bluesky network, so that I can have private/internal community discussions that don't clutter my public Bluesky profile.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in community member, **When** I create a post in the community timeline, **Then** the post is stored in my PDS using the custom Lexicon schema and flows through AT Protocol Relay to be indexed
2. **Given** I created an internal post, **When** other community members view the timeline, **Then** they can see my post in chronological order (indexed via Firehose ‚Üí Durable Objects cache)
3. **Given** I view my Bluesky profile in the official app, **When** I check my posts, **Then** internal community posts do not appear (official apps only show app.bsky.feed.post)
4. **Given** existing posts were indexed from Bluesky Firehose, **When** the system is updated, **Then** those posts remain in the feed cache but new posts use the custom Lexicon

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to share/repost an internal post to Bluesky? (Internal posts remain separate from Bluesky social graph)
- How does the system handle existing posts that were indexed from the Bluesky Firehose? (Coexist during transition period, gradually expire from 7-day cache)
- Can users optionally publish internal posts to Bluesky later? (Future enhancement - not in scope for this feature)
- What happens to posts if a user leaves the community? (Posts remain in user's PDS, but may be excluded from timeline based on membership status)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Post Creation & Storage**
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow community members to create posts that are stored in their PDS using a custom AT Protocol Lexicon schema (net.atrarium.community.post)
- **FR-002**: System MUST store posts in the user's PDS, not in Bluesky's app.bsky.feed.post collection
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve post authorship information (author DID, display name)
- **FR-004**: System MUST associate each post with a specific community ID (immutable, survives stage transitions)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support plain text post content initially (rich media deferred to future enhancement)
- **FR-021**: System MUST allow posts in communities at any stage (theme, community, or graduated)
- **FR-022**: Posts MUST remain associated with their original community when stage changes (theme ‚Üí community ‚Üí graduated)

**Bluesky Lexicon Integration**
- **FR-016**: System MUST continue to use app.bsky.actor.profile for user profile information (avatar, display name, bio)
- **FR-017**: System MUST NOT replace all Bluesky Lexicons, only app.bsky.feed.post with net.atrarium.community.post
- **FR-018**: System MUST fetch user profile data from Bluesky AppView or PDS when displaying posts

**Timeline Display & Querying**
- **FR-006**: System MUST display internal posts in community timelines in reverse chronological order
- **FR-007**: System MUST index posts from AT Protocol Relay/Firehose (all Lexicons including net.atrarium.community.post are available)
- **FR-008**: System MUST cache indexed posts in Durable Objects for performance (7-day TTL maintained)
- **FR-009**: System MUST verify membership status before including posts in timeline
- **FR-019**: System MUST serve timeline via Dashboard API only (not via AT Protocol Feed Generator API)
- **FR-020**: System MUST deprecate Feed Generator API (`getFeedSkeleton`) as Bluesky AppView cannot render custom Lexicon posts

**Data Ownership & Portability**
- **FR-010**: Posts MUST remain in user's PDS permanently (not subject to 7-day expiry like cache)
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to export/migrate their posts by exporting their PDS data (inherent AT Protocol capability)
- **FR-012**: Posts MUST NOT appear in official Bluesky apps (separate Lexicon collection)

**Migration & Compatibility**
- **FR-013**: System MUST continue to support existing Bluesky Firehose-indexed posts during transition period
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow coexistence of old (app.bsky.feed.post) and new (net.atrarium.community.post) posts in timeline
- **FR-015**: System MUST stop indexing new app.bsky.feed.post posts after migration

### Key Entities
- **Post (net.atrarium.community.post)**: AT Protocol record containing text content, community ID, created timestamp, author reference
- **Profile (app.bsky.actor.profile)**: User profile data from Bluesky (avatar, display name, bio) - reused, not replaced
- **Timeline**: Aggregated view of posts from all community members, indexed via Firehose, filtered by membership and moderation status
- **Author**: User identity (DID), profile data from app.bsky.actor.profile, community membership status (verified via net.atrarium.community.membership)

## Constitution Compliance ‚úÖ

**Selected Approach: Interpretation A** - This specification fully complies with all Project Constitution principles:

**Principle 4: Decentralized Identity and Data Ownership** ‚úÖ
- Posts stored in user's PDS using custom Lexicon
- Users maintain full ownership and portability of their content
- Data can be exported/migrated via standard AT Protocol mechanisms

**Principle 5: PDS-First Architecture** ‚úÖ
- PDS remains the source of truth for all post data
- Durable Objects continue as 7-day performance cache
- Direct PDS querying replaces Firehose indexing

**Principle 8: AT Protocol + PDS + Lexicon Constraints** ‚úÖ
- All features implemented using AT Protocol + PDS + custom Lexicon (net.atrarium.community.post)
- No separate databases required
- Pure AT Protocol approach maintained

**Design Philosophy: Protocol-First Architecture** ‚úÖ
- Value remains in Lexicon schemas (net.atrarium.community.post definition)
- Implementation remains replaceable
- Other AT Protocol services can implement the same Lexicon

**Positioning vs Competitors** ‚úÖ
- All data stored in user PDSs using standard AT Protocol records
- DID-based portable identity maintained
- Decentralized architecture preserved

## Next Steps

**Status**: ‚úÖ Specification complete and ready for planning

This specification can now proceed to `/plan` phase. The implementation will:

1. Define new AT Protocol Lexicon schema: `net.atrarium.community.post`
2. Update post creation API to write to PDS using custom Lexicon
3. Update Firehose filtering to index `net.atrarium.community.post` (in addition to existing filters)
4. Maintain Durable Objects caching for performance (7-day TTL)
5. Continue using `app.bsky.actor.profile` for user profile data (not replaced)
6. Support coexistence of legacy `app.bsky.feed.post` and new `net.atrarium.community.post` during transition
7. Deprecate Feed Generator API (`getFeedSkeleton`) - custom Lexicon posts not compatible with Bluesky AppView
8. Serve timeline exclusively via Dashboard API (`GET /api/communities/{id}/posts`)
