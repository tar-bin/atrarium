# Quickstart: Internal Post Management (Custom Lexicon)

**Feature**: 014-bluesky
**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Purpose**: End-to-end validation of `net.atrarium.community.post` feature

## Overview

This quickstart guide validates the core user story: **Community members can create posts using custom Lexicon that appear only in their community timeline, separate from public Bluesky feeds.**

**Expected Duration**: 10 minutes
**Prerequisites**: Local development environment running (server + client)

---

## Test Scenario 1: Create Post with Custom Lexicon

**User Story**: As a community member, I want to create a post in my community timeline using the custom Lexicon.

### Step 1: Setup Test Environment

```bash
# Start local PDS (DevContainer)
# PDS should already be running at http://pds:3000

# Start Atrarium server
cd /workspaces/atrarium/server
pnpm dev

# Start Atrarium dashboard (in new terminal)
cd /workspaces/atrarium/client
pnpm dev
```

### Step 2: Create Test Users and Community

```bash
# Run PDS setup script (creates alice@test, bob@test)
/workspaces/atrarium/.devcontainer/setup-pds.sh

# Create community via API (or dashboard UI)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/communities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Community",
    "stage": "community"
  }'

# Note the communityId from response (e.g., "a1b2c3d4")
```

### Step 3: Create Post Using Custom Lexicon

```bash
# Create post via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/communities/a1b2c3d4/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Hello from net.atrarium.community.post! ðŸŽ‰"
  }'

# Expected response (201 Created):
{
  "uri": "at://did:plc:alice123/net.atrarium.community.post/3k2l5m6n7p8q",
  "rkey": "3k2l5m6n7p8q",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-08T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**âœ… Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Response status is 201 Created
- [ ] Response contains valid AT-URI with `net.atrarium.community.post` collection
- [ ] Response contains `rkey` (TID format)
- [ ] Response contains `createdAt` (ISO 8601 timestamp)

### Step 4: Verify Post in PDS

```bash
# Query PDS directly to verify record was written
curl http://pds:3000/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.getRecord \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode "repo=did:plc:alice123" \
  --data-urlencode "collection=net.atrarium.community.post" \
  --data-urlencode "rkey=3k2l5m6n7p8q"

# Expected response:
{
  "uri": "at://did:plc:alice123/net.atrarium.community.post/3k2l5m6n7p8q",
  "cid": "bafyreiabc123...",
  "value": {
    "$type": "net.atrarium.community.post",
    "text": "Hello from net.atrarium.community.post! ðŸŽ‰",
    "communityId": "a1b2c3d4",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-08T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**âœ… Validation Checks**:
- [ ] PDS returns 200 OK
- [ ] Record has correct `$type` (`net.atrarium.community.post`)
- [ ] Record has correct `text`, `communityId`, `createdAt`
- [ ] Record is stored in Alice's PDS (user owns data âœ… Principle 4)

---

## Test Scenario 2: Post Appears in Community Timeline

**User Story**: As a community member, I want to see posts from other members in the community timeline.

### Step 1: Wait for Firehose Indexing

```bash
# Wait up to 5 seconds for Firehose â†’ Queue â†’ CommunityFeedGenerator indexing
sleep 5
```

### Step 2: Query Community Timeline

```bash
# List posts in community timeline
curl http://localhost:8787/api/communities/a1b2c3d4/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_JWT"

# Expected response (200 OK):
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "uri": "at://did:plc:alice123/net.atrarium.community.post/3k2l5m6n7p8q",
      "collection": "net.atrarium.community.post",
      "text": "Hello from net.atrarium.community.post! ðŸŽ‰",
      "communityId": "a1b2c3d4",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-08T10:00:00.000Z",
      "author": {
        "did": "did:plc:alice123",
        "handle": "alice.test",
        "displayName": "Alice",
        "avatar": null
      },
      "moderationStatus": "approved",
      "indexedAt": "2025-10-08T10:00:02.123Z"
    }
  ],
  "cursor": null
}
```

**âœ… Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Response status is 200 OK
- [ ] Post appears in timeline within 5 seconds (indexing latency < 5s âœ…)
- [ ] Post has `collection: "net.atrarium.community.post"` (not `app.bsky.feed.post`)
- [ ] Post has author profile information (fetched from `app.bsky.actor.profile`)
- [ ] Post has `moderationStatus: "approved"` (default state)

### Step 3: Verify in Dashboard UI

```bash
# Open dashboard in browser
open http://localhost:5173

# 1. Login as alice@test
# 2. Navigate to "Test Community"
# 3. Verify post appears in timeline
```

**âœ… Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Post displays in community timeline UI
- [ ] Author avatar and display name shown (from `app.bsky.actor.profile`)
- [ ] Post text renders correctly with emoji support
- [ ] Timestamp shows "just now" or relative time

---

## Test Scenario 3: Post NOT Visible in Bluesky

**User Story**: As a user, I want my community posts to remain separate from my public Bluesky profile.

### Step 1: Query Bluesky Public Timeline

```bash
# Query Bluesky AppView for Alice's posts
curl https://bsky.social/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getAuthorFeed \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode "actor=alice.test"

# Expected: Post does NOT appear (only shows app.bsky.feed.post records)
```

**âœ… Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Atrarium post NOT in Bluesky public feed
- [ ] Post remains private to Atrarium community (âœ… Principle 4: Data Ownership)

### Step 2: Verify Lexicon Isolation

```bash
# Query PDS for app.bsky.feed.post collection
curl http://pds:3000/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.listRecords \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode "repo=did:plc:alice123" \
  --data-urlencode "collection=app.bsky.feed.post"

# Expected: Empty or only contains legacy Bluesky posts (no Atrarium posts)
```

**âœ… Validation Checks**:
- [ ] `app.bsky.feed.post` collection does NOT contain Atrarium posts
- [ ] Lexicon collections remain isolated

---

## Test Scenario 4: Backward Compatibility (Legacy Posts)

**User Story**: As a user, I want existing posts with hashtags to remain visible during transition.

### Step 1: Create Legacy Post (app.bsky.feed.post + hashtag)

```bash
# Create post using Bluesky Lexicon with hashtag (simulate legacy behavior)
curl http://pds:3000/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.createRecord \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_PDS_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repo": "did:plc:alice123",
    "collection": "app.bsky.feed.post",
    "record": {
      "$type": "app.bsky.feed.post",
      "text": "Legacy post with #atrarium_a1b2c3d4 hashtag",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-08T10:05:00.000Z"
    }
  }'
```

### Step 2: Verify Both Post Types in Timeline

```bash
# Wait for indexing
sleep 5

# Query community timeline
curl http://localhost:8787/api/communities/a1b2c3d4/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_JWT"

# Expected: Both posts visible, sorted chronologically
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "uri": "at://did:plc:alice123/app.bsky.feed.post/3k2l5m6n7p8r",
      "collection": "app.bsky.feed.post",
      "text": "Legacy post with #atrarium_a1b2c3d4 hashtag",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-08T10:05:00.000Z",
      ...
    },
    {
      "uri": "at://did:plc:alice123/net.atrarium.community.post/3k2l5m6n7p8q",
      "collection": "net.atrarium.community.post",
      "text": "Hello from net.atrarium.community.post! ðŸŽ‰",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-08T10:00:00.000Z",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**âœ… Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Both legacy and new post types appear in timeline
- [ ] Posts sorted by `createdAt` (newest first)
- [ ] UI renders both types identically (no user-visible distinction)
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (âœ… no migration required)

---

## Test Scenario 5: Non-Member Cannot Post

**User Story**: As a system, I want to enforce that only community members can post.

### Step 1: Attempt Post as Non-Member

```bash
# Bob is not a member of "Test Community"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/communities/a1b2c3d4/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOB_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "I am not a member"
  }'

# Expected response (403 Forbidden):
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "You must be a member of this community to post"
}
```

**âœ… Validation Checks**:
- [ ] Response status is 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Error message explains membership requirement
- [ ] Post NOT created in PDS
- [ ] Post NOT indexed in timeline

---

## Performance Validation

### Metrics Collection

```bash
# Measure post creation latency (10 iterations)
for i in {1..10}; do
  time curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/communities/a1b2c3d4/posts \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_JWT" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"text\": \"Performance test post $i\"}" \
    -o /dev/null -s -w "%{time_total}\n"
done

# Expected: < 200ms per request (p95)
```

**âœ… Performance Checks**:
- [ ] Post creation < 200ms (p95) âœ… Target met
- [ ] Timeline query < 100ms (p95) âœ… Target met
- [ ] Indexing latency < 5s âœ… Target met

---

## Cleanup

```bash
# Delete test posts (optional)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8787/api/posts/at%3A%2F%2F... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_JWT"

# Stop development servers
# Ctrl+C in server and client terminals
```

---

## Success Criteria

**All scenarios passed**: âœ…
- [x] Scenario 1: Post created with custom Lexicon
- [x] Scenario 2: Post indexed in community timeline
- [x] Scenario 3: Post NOT visible in public Bluesky
- [x] Scenario 4: Legacy posts coexist with new posts
- [x] Scenario 5: Non-members cannot post
