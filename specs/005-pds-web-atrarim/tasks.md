# Tasks: Web Dashboard for Atrarium with Local PDS Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/workspaces/atrarium/specs/005-pds-web-atrarim/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/components.yaml, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: React 18, Vite 5, TanStack (Query/Router/Table), shadcn/ui, oRPC
   → Structure: New dashboard/ directory at repo root
2. Load optional design documents ✅
   → data-model.md: 6 entities (UserSession, Community, Feed, Post, ModerationAction, Membership)
   → contracts/: components.yaml with 15 components
   → research.md: 15 technical decisions
   → quickstart.md: 10-step development workflow
3. Generate tasks by category ✅
   → Setup: Vite project, dependencies, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, i18n
   → Tests: 15 component tests + 5 integration tests
   → Core: 15 components + utilities + routes
   → Integration: oRPC setup, PDS client, API integration
   → Polish: i18n translations, README, cleanup
4. Apply task rules ✅
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...) ✅
6. Generate dependency graph ✅
7. Create parallel execution examples ✅
8. Validate task completeness ✅
   → All 15 components have tests ✅
   → All entities have type definitions ✅
   → All integration scenarios covered ✅
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution) ✅
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Frontend**: `dashboard/src/`, `dashboard/tests/`
- **Backend**: `src/` (existing, no changes)
- **Tests**: `dashboard/tests/` (unit, component, integration)

---

## Phase 3.0: Backend API Extensions (Prerequisites)

**CRITICAL: These backend tasks MUST complete before frontend implementation**

- [x] **T000a** - [P] Add PATCH /api/communities/:id endpoint in `src/routes/communities.ts`
  - Implement: Update community name and/or description
  - Validate: Name (1-50 chars if provided), ownerDid matches authenticated user
  - Query: `UPDATE communities SET name = ?, description = ?, updated_at = ? WHERE id = ? AND owner_did = ?`
  - Return: Updated Community object (200 OK) or 403 Forbidden if not owner
  - Register: Route in Hono app (`.patch('/api/communities/:id', handler)`)
  - Add: Contract test in `tests/contract/dashboard/update-community.test.ts`
  - Verify: Test passes, endpoint returns updated community, type exported for oRPC
  - **COMPLETED**: Endpoint exists, validation schemas updated (50 char limit), 7 tests passing

- [x] **T000b** - [P] Add POST /api/communities/:id/close endpoint in `src/routes/communities.ts`
  - **Schema Note**: `communities` table has `archived_at` column (schema.sql:L22) - use this for archiving
  - Implement: Archive/close community by setting `archived_at` timestamp
  - Validate: ownerDid matches authenticated user
  - Query: `UPDATE communities SET archived_at = ? WHERE id = ? AND owner_did = ? AND archived_at IS NULL`
  - Return: Updated Community object (200 OK) or 403 Forbidden if not owner or 409 Conflict if already archived
  - Register: Route in Hono app (`.post('/api/communities/:id/close', handler)`)
  - Add: Contract test in `tests/contract/dashboard/close-community.test.ts`
  - Test cases: Success (owner), Forbidden (non-owner), Conflict (already archived)
  - Verify: Test passes, community.archived_at set, type exported for oRPC
  - **COMPLETED**: Endpoint implemented with CommunityModel.isArchived() helper, 5 tests passing

- [x] **T000c** - Verify backend exports AppType for oRPC in `src/index.ts`
  - Check: `export type AppType = typeof app` exists at end of file
  - If missing: Add `export type AppType = typeof app;` after Hono app definition
  - Verify: TypeScript compiles without errors
  - Verify: oRPC client in T010 can import AppType successfully
  - Note: This enables end-to-end type safety between backend and frontend

## Dependencies

**Backend prerequisites**:
- T000a, T000b, T000c (Backend API + oRPC setup) MUST complete before frontend work starts
- T000a, T000b can run in parallel (different endpoints)
- T000c must complete before T010 (oRPC client needs AppType export)

**Setup before all**:
- T000a, T000b, T000c block T001 (cannot test frontend without backend API)
- T000c blocks T010 (oRPC client import)
- T001 (Vite init) must complete before T002-T009
- T002 (dependencies) blocks T003-T009
- T009 (MSW handlers) blocks all integration tests (T056-T060)
- T009 must mock new PATCH/POST endpoints (T000a, T000b)

**Tests before implementation**:
- T014-T030 (component tests) MUST FAIL before T031-T047 (component implementation)
- Each test (T0XX) blocks its corresponding implementation (T0XX+17 typically)

**Context before routes**:
- T054 (PDS context) blocks T049-T053 (pages/routes)
- T055 (Query client) blocks T050-T053 (pages using TanStack Query)

**Routes before integration tests**:
- T048-T053 (routes/pages) block T056-T060 (integration tests)

**Polish at end**:
- T061-T070 (polish/docs) come after all implementation and integration tests

**Can run in parallel** (marked with [P]):
- T003, T004, T005, T006, T007, T008 (different config files)
- T010, T011, T012, T013 (different utility files)
- T014-T030 (all component tests, different files)
- T031-T046 (most component implementations, different files except modals)
- T056-T060 (integration tests, different files)
- T061, T062 (i18n files, different locales)
- T063, T064, T065, T066 (different docs/components)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **TDD workflow**: Write failing tests first (T014-T030), then implement components (T031-T047)
- **MSW**: All API calls are mocked in tests for fast, reliable testing
- **oRPC**: Provides end-to-end type safety between backend (Hono) and frontend (React)
- **TanStack Router**: File-based routing with type-safe params
- **i18n**: English is primary, Japanese is translation (maintain parity)
- **Commit**: After each task or logical group of tasks
- **Verify**: Each task includes verification step
