## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: How should users authenticate to access the dashboard? ‚Üí A: Use PDS credentials directly (dashboard calls PDS login API)
- Q: Can moderators create new theme feeds, or is that restricted to owners only? ‚Üí A: All members can create feeds (automatic archiving handles lifecycle)
- Q: Who can view hidden posts in the "Hidden Posts" tab? ‚Üí A: Moderators and owners only
- Q: What should the dashboard do when PDS posting fails? ‚Üí A: Display error message only, no automatic retry (user manually retries)
- Q: Maximum character limits for community and feed names? ‚Üí A: 50 characters for both
- Q: Frontend framework preferences? ‚Üí A: TanStack ecosystem (React Query + Router + Table) for Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Q: Multi-language support requirements? ‚Üí A: English and Japanese support via react-i18next, browser language auto-detect, manual language toggle
- Q: UI component library preferences? ‚Üí A: shadcn/ui for accessible, customizable components with Tailwind CSS
- Q: Additional frontend utilities? ‚Üí A: react-hook-form + Zod (validation), lucide-react (icons), date-fns (dates), react-error-boundary (errors), oRPC (type-safe API)
- Q: Frontend testing strategy? ‚Üí A: Vitest + @testing-library/react + MSW (three-layer: unit 50%, component 30%, integration 20%)
- Q: Community name uniqueness enforcement? ‚Üí A: No uniqueness requirement - duplicate names allowed, only UUID collision prevention guaranteed (database-level)
- Q: Can community owners update or delete/close communities? ‚Üí A: Yes, owners can update community info and close (archive) communities

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A community owner wants to manage their Atrarium community through a visual web interface instead of using API tools. They need to:
1. Create a new community with a name and description
2. Create theme feeds within the community, each receiving a unique hashtag
3. Post messages to their local Bluesky PDS that include feed hashtags
4. View all posts associated with a specific feed
5. Moderate content by hiding inappropriate posts or blocking users

### Acceptance Scenarios

0. **Given** a user opens the dashboard for the first time, **When** they enter their PDS handle and password (e.g., alice.test/test123), **Then** the system authenticates via PDS login API and grants access to dashboard features

1. **Given** a user opens the dashboard, **When** they click "Create Community" and fill in the form with valid data, **Then** the community appears in the community list and they can access its detail page

2. **Given** a community exists, **When** the owner creates a new theme feed, **Then** the system generates a unique hashtag (format: #atr_xxxxx) and displays it for the owner to share

3. **Given** a user is authenticated with their local PDS account, **When** they write a post in the feed's post creation form, **Then** the system automatically appends the feed's hashtag and posts to the local PDS

4. **Given** posts exist in a feed, **When** the user views the feed detail page, **Then** they see a list of posts showing author, text, and timestamp

5. **Given** a user has moderator role, **When** they click "Hide" on a post, **Then** the post is marked as hidden and no longer appears in the public feed view

6. **Given** a blocked user exists, **When** they attempt to post to the feed, **Then** their posts do not appear in the feed (blocked at indexing time)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to create a community with a duplicate name?
- How does the system handle posts exceeding 300 characters?
- When the local PDS is offline during post creation, the dashboard displays an error message and the user must manually retry after PDS is back online
- How are posts from non-members displayed (should they be filtered out)?
- What happens if a feed hashtag generation fails (collision after retries)?
- How does the dashboard handle concurrent moderation actions on the same post?

   - Separate dashboard authentication system
   - OAuth flow with PDS

2. **User Role Permissions**:
   - Can moderators create feeds, or only owners?
   - Who can view hidden posts (only moderators, or also owners)?
   - Can members invite other members?

3. **Community Name Uniqueness**: Should community names be unique globally, per user, or no restriction?

4. **String Length Limits**: What are the maximum character limits for:
   - Community name and description
   - Feed name and description
   - Moderation action reason

5. **Community Lifecycle**: Can users update or delete communities? If yes, what happens to:
   - Existing feeds within the community
   - Posts already indexed
   - Memberships

6. **Error Handling & Retry**:
   - Should the dashboard retry failed PDS posts?
   - How to handle offline PDS (queue posts, show error, disable posting)?
   - Should moderation actions be reversible indefinitely?
