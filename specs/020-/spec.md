## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11
- Q: Which areas should be prioritized for reorganization (server services, client hooks, both, or utilities)? ‚Üí A: Both server and client
- Q: What is the line count threshold for identifying files that should be split? ‚Üí A: 500 lines, prioritizing domain-driven design (DDD) domain boundaries over strict line counts
- Q: What is the backward compatibility policy for internal refactoring? ‚Üí A: Breaking changes allowed - reorganize to optimal structure without compatibility constraints
- Q: How should Git history be handled when moving files? ‚Üí A: Accept history loss - prioritize clean structure over git blame tracking
- Q: How should duplicate utility functions between server and client be handled? ‚Üí A: Move to shared workspace for reuse across both workspaces

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Atrarium codebase, I need well-organized source files so that:
1. I can quickly locate relevant code without searching through large monolithic files
2. I can understand module boundaries and dependencies clearly
3. I can navigate the codebase efficiently using IDE tools
4. New contributors can onboard faster by following clear organizational patterns

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer needs to find emoji validation logic, **When** they browse the project structure, **Then** they should find it in a clearly named directory with related files grouped together

2. **Given** a developer is reading a service class file, **When** the file contains multiple related responsibilities, **Then** each responsibility should be separated into focused modules with clear names

3. **Given** a maintainer reviews the component directory, **When** they examine the folder structure, **Then** they should see logical grouping (e.g., communities/, moderation/, emoji/) rather than flat lists

4. **Given** a new contributor explores client hooks, **When** they open the hooks directory, **Then** they should find hooks organized by feature domain rather than in a single large file

5. **Given** the build system processes source files, **When** file reorganization is complete, **Then** all imports should resolve correctly without build errors

6. **Given** existing tests run against reorganized code, **When** tests execute, **Then** all tests should pass without modification (if using barrel exports)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when reorganizing files that are imported by external packages (e.g., `@atrarium/contracts`)? ‚Üí Internal refactoring only; external packages unaffected
- How does the system handle git history preservation when moving files? ‚Üí History loss accepted for cleaner structure (no `git mv` required)
- What happens to absolute import paths that reference old file locations? ‚Üí All imports updated to new locations (breaking changes accepted)
- How are circular dependencies detected and prevented after reorganization? ‚Üí Verified by TypeScript compiler during typecheck

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-001**: System MUST identify files exceeding 500 lines as candidates for splitting, with domain-driven design (DDD) domain boundaries taking precedence over strict line count (e.g., split by feature domains like emoji, moderation, communities even if under 500 lines when domains are clearly separable)

**FR-002**: System MUST group related functionality into cohesive modules based on domain responsibility (e.g., emoji operations, moderation actions, hierarchy management)

**FR-003**: System MAY break internal import paths within server/ and client/ workspaces to achieve optimal domain structure (breaking changes allowed for internal refactoring)

**FR-004**: System MUST update all internal imports to reflect new file locations (no backward compatibility requirement for internal code)

**FR-005**: System MUST organize client components into feature-based subdirectories (already exists: communities/, emoji/, moderation/, etc.) and split large client files (e.g., hooks.ts 433 lines)

**FR-006**: System MUST organize server utilities/services into feature-based subdirectories and split large server files (e.g., atproto.ts 1606 lines)

**FR-007**: System MUST separate React hooks by feature domain rather than keeping all hooks in a single file, covering both server and client codebases

**FR-008**: System MUST ensure all TypeScript imports resolve correctly after reorganization (verified by `pnpm -r typecheck`)

**FR-009**: System MUST ensure all tests pass after reorganization (verified by `pnpm -r test`)

**FR-010**: System MUST document the new organizational structure in relevant README files

**FR-011**: System MUST identify and eliminate duplicate utility functions across server and client (e.g., hashtag validation, emoji validation) by moving them to `shared/` workspace for reuse

**FR-012**: System MAY reorganize files without preserving git history (accept history loss for cleaner structure - git blame tracking not required)

*Architecture Constraints (Constitution Principle 8):*
- This feature involves code organization only - no persistent data storage required
- No database implications - purely structural refactoring

### Key Entities

**Large Files**: Source files identified as candidates for splitting based on size or responsibility count
- Attributes: File path, line count, number of exported functions/classes, dependency count
- Examples: `/workspaces/atrarium/server/src/services/atproto.ts` (1606 lines), `/workspaces/atrarium/client/src/lib/hooks.ts` (433 lines)

**Feature Domains**: Logical groupings of related functionality
- Attributes: Domain name (e.g., "emoji", "moderation", "communities"), associated files, cross-domain dependencies
- Examples: Emoji management (upload, validation, approval), Community hierarchy (parent/child, stage transitions)

**Module Dependencies**: Import/export relationships between files
- Attributes: Importer file, imported file, import type (default/named), usage context
- Purpose: Ensure reorganization doesn't break dependency chains

**Barrel Exports**: Index files that re-export modules to maintain backward compatibility
- Attributes: Directory path, exported symbols, original module paths
- Purpose: Preserve import paths for external consumers (Note: Not required for this refactoring per clarification)

**Shared Utilities**: Common utility functions used by both server and client
- Attributes: Function name, domain (hashtag, emoji, validation), current locations (server/client)
- Purpose: Eliminate code duplication by consolidating to `shared/` workspace
