# Tasks: Client Use Case Implementation for General Users and Community Administrators

**Input**: Design documents from `/workspaces/atrarium/specs/013-/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo**: client/, server/, shared/contracts/ at repository root
- All paths are absolute from `/workspaces/atrarium/`

## Critical Updates from /clarify Session (2025-10-07)

**Join Request Storage**:
- ✅ Use `status: 'pending'` field in existing `net.atrarium.community.membership`
- ❌ NO new `net.atrarium.community.joinRequest` Lexicon schema

**Community Statistics**:
- ✅ PDS-feasible metrics only: member count, pending request count
- ❌ NO activity metrics (post volume, active members)

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Prerequisites

- [x] T001 Validate PDS-only storage architecture (Constitution Principle 8 - no databases beyond Durable Objects cache)
- [x] T002 Verify Biome linter configuration applies to new files (Constitution Principle 7)
- [x] T003 Verify TypeScript type checking applies to new files (Constitution Principle 7)
- [x] T004 [P] Update Lexicon schema `lexicons/net.atrarium.community.membership.json` to add `status` field (enum: ["active", "pending"])
- [x] T005 [P] Update Lexicon schema `lexicons/net.atrarium.community.config.json` to add `accessType` field (enum: ["open", "invite-only"])
- [x] T006 Regenerate TypeScript types from Lexicon schemas (pnpm --filter server codegen)
- [x] T007 [P] Review existing oRPC contract structure in shared/contracts/src/router.ts
- [x] T008 [P] Review existing PDS service methods in server/src/services/atproto.ts

## Phase 3.2: Shared Contracts (oRPC) ⚠️ Foundation for all subsequent work

**CRITICAL: These contracts MUST be completed before any server or client implementation**

- [x] T009 [P] Add membership Zod schemas in shared/contracts/src/schemas.ts (JoinCommunitySchema, LeaveCommunitySchema, ListMembersSchema, ChangeMemberRoleSchema, RemoveMemberSchema, TransferOwnershipSchema)
- [x] T010 [P] Add join request Zod schemas in shared/contracts/src/schemas.ts (ListJoinRequestsSchema, ApproveJoinRequestSchema, RejectJoinRequestSchema - NOTE: filter by status='pending' in existing membership records)
- [x] T011 [P] Add moderation Zod schemas in shared/contracts/src/schemas.ts (HidePostSchema, UnhidePostSchema, BlockUserSchema, UnblockUserSchema, ModerationHistorySchema)
- [x] T012 [P] Add feed Zod schemas in shared/contracts/src/schemas.ts (GetFeedSchema, GetStatsSchema - NOTE: stats limited to memberCount and pendingRequestCount only)
- [x] T013 Add memberships router contract in shared/contracts/src/router.ts (export membershipsContract with 7 endpoints including ownership transfer)
- [x] T014 Add joinRequests router contract in shared/contracts/src/router.ts (export joinRequestsContract with 3 endpoints - operates on membership records with status='pending')
- [x] T015 Add moderation router contract in shared/contracts/src/router.ts (export moderationContract with 5 endpoints)
- [x] T016 Add feeds router contract in shared/contracts/src/router.ts (export feedsContract with 2 endpoints)
- [x] T017 Update root contract in shared/contracts/src/router.ts to include memberships, joinRequests, moderation, feeds
- [x] T018 Update TypeScript types in shared/contracts/src/types.ts (MembershipResponse with status field, JoinRequestResponse, ModerationActionResponse, FeedResponse, StatsResponse with memberCount and pendingRequestCount only)
- [x] T019 Run TypeScript type check on shared/contracts/ (pnpm --filter @atrarium/contracts typecheck)

## Phase 3.3: Server - PDS Service Layer

**CRITICAL: PDS service methods MUST write to user PDSs using AT Protocol Lexicon schemas**

- [x] T020 [P] Add createMembership method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (writes to net.atrarium.community.membership in user's PDS with status='active' or 'pending' based on accessType)
- [x] T021 [P] Add deleteMembership method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (deactivates membership record in user's PDS - set active=false)
- [x] T022 [P] Add listMemberships method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (reads net.atrarium.community.membership records, supports filtering by status)
- [x] T023 [P] Add updateMembershipRole method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (updates role field in membership record, enforces owner uniqueness)
- [x] T024 [P] Add updateMembershipStatus method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (changes status='pending' → 'active' for join request approval)
- [x] T025 [P] Add transferOwnership method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (updates two membership records: old owner → member, new member → owner)
- [x] T026 [P] Add createModerationAction method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (writes to net.atrarium.moderation.action in moderator's PDS)
- [x] T027 [P] Add listModerationActions method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (reads moderation action records from community)
- [x] T028 [P] Add getCommunityStats method in server/src/services/atproto.ts (counts memberships: memberCount = status='active' AND active=true, pendingRequestCount = status='pending' - NO activity metrics)

## Phase 3.4: Server - Membership Routes

- [x] T029 Implement POST /api/memberships endpoint in server/src/routes/memberships.ts (join community - create membership with status based on accessType, check for duplicates)
- [x] T030 Implement DELETE /api/memberships/:communityId endpoint in server/src/routes/memberships.ts (leave community - set active=false)
- [x] T031 Implement GET /api/memberships/my endpoint in server/src/routes/memberships.ts (list user's memberships)

- Lexicon updates (T004-T006) before server implementation
- Contracts (T009-T019) before server and client implementation
- PDS Service Layer (T020-T028) before server routes (T029-T045)
- Server routes (T029-T045) before server tests (T046-T067)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files or independent methods, no dependencies
- **Constitution Principle 8**: All persistent storage must use PDS + Lexicon schemas (no separate databases)
- **Join Request Implementation**: Use `status: 'pending'` in existing `net.atrarium.community.membership` schema (NO new Lexicon schema)
- **Community Statistics**: Limited to PDS-feasible metrics (memberCount, pendingRequestCount) - NO activity metrics (post volume, active members)
- **Polling Strategy**: TanStack Query `refetchInterval` 10-30s for stats/members, `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` for inactive tabs
- **Caching Strategy**: Static data (name, description) 5 minutes, dynamic data (members, stats) 10-30 second polling
- **i18n**: All user-facing strings must have EN + JA translations
- **Type Safety**: oRPC contracts ensure type safety from client to server
- **Testing**: TDD approach - write tests before implementation where possible
- **PDS Integration**: Test with local PDS in DevContainer using `.devcontainer/setup-pds.sh`
- **Performance**: Leverage TanStack Query caching (5-minute stale time for static data, 10-30s polling for dynamic)
- **Accessibility**: Use shadcn/ui components for built-in accessibility support
- **Mobile**: All layouts must be responsive (Tailwind CSS breakpoints)

## Task Complexity Estimate

- **Total Tasks**: 135
- **Parallel Tasks**: ~70 (52% can run in parallel)
- **Sequential Tasks**: ~65 (depend on prior completion)
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium (extends existing patterns, no new infrastructure)
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks (with parallel execution)

## Ready for Implementation
