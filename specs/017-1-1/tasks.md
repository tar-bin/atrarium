# Tasks: Hierarchical Group System

**Feature**: 017-1-1
**Input**: Design documents from `/workspaces/atrarium/specs/017-1-1/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/hierarchy-api.md, quickstart.md

---

## Overview

This document provides executable tasks for implementing the hierarchical group system. Tasks are ordered by dependencies and marked with [P] for parallel execution where applicable.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **TDD Order**: Contract tests → Implementation → Integration tests
- **PDS-First**: All writes to PDS, Durable Objects as 7-day cache (Principle 8)
- **Complete Implementation**: No MVP deferrals (Principle 10)
- **Parallel Execution**: [P] tasks can run concurrently (different files, no dependencies)

---

## Phase 3.1: Setup and Prerequisites

- [x] **T001** Validate existing project structure (monorepo with server/, client/, shared/contracts/)
- [x] **T002** [P] Review Lexicon schemas in `lexicons/net.atrarium.group.config.json` (verify `parentGroup` field exists)
- [x] **T003** [P] Verify PDS-first architecture constraints (no new databases, Durable Objects cache only)
- [x] **T004** [P] Confirm Biome linting/formatting configuration (Constitution Principle 7)
- [x] **T005** [P] Confirm TypeScript type checking configuration (Constitution Principle 7)

---

## Phase 3.2: Contract Tests (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

**CRITICAL**: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation begins.

### Backend Contract Tests (6 endpoints)

- [x] **T006** [P] Contract test `groups.createChild` in `server/tests/contract/hierarchy/create-child.test.ts`
  - Test: Graduated parent creates Theme child → success (child has parent AT-URI)
  - Test: Community parent creates child → 409 Conflict (only Graduated can create children)
  - Test: Non-owner attempts createChild → 403 Forbidden
  - Test: Child created with `stage: 'theme'` and immutable `parentGroup` field

- [x] **T007** [P] Contract test `groups.upgradeStage` in `server/tests/contract/hierarchy/upgrade-stage.test.ts`
  - Test: Theme → Community with memberCount >= 15 → success
  - Test: Theme → Community with memberCount < 15 → 409 Conflict (threshold not met)
  - Test: Community → Graduated with memberCount >= 50 → success
  - Test: Community → Graduated with memberCount < 50 → 409 Conflict
  - Test: Invalid stage transitions (e.g., Theme → Graduated) → 400 Bad Request

- [x] **T008** [P] Contract test `groups.downgradeStage` in `server/tests/contract/hierarchy/downgrade-stage.test.ts`
  - Test: Graduated → Community → success (moderation remains independent)
  - Test: Community → Theme → success (moderation switches to inherited)
  - Test: Graduated with children → Community → success (children retained, but cannot create more)
  - Test: Invalid downgrade (e.g., Theme → Graduated) → 400 Bad Request

- [x] **T009** [P] Contract test `groups.listChildren` in `server/tests/contract/hierarchy/list-children.test.ts`
  - Test: Graduated parent with 3 children → returns all children
  - Test: Graduated parent with no children → returns empty array
  - Test: Community parent (no children capability) → returns empty array
  - Test: Pagination with cursor → returns correct page

- [x] **T010** [P] Contract test `groups.getParent` in `server/tests/contract/hierarchy/get-parent.test.ts`
  - Test: Theme child with parent → returns Graduated parent
  - Test: Graduated group (no parent) → returns null
  - Test: Community group (no parent) → returns null
  - Test: Invalid child ID → 404 Not Found

- [x] **T011** [P] Contract test `groups.delete` (extended validation) in `server/tests/contract/hierarchy/delete-with-children.test.ts`
  - Test: Delete Graduated with 2 children → 409 Conflict (lists child names)
  - Test: Delete Graduated with no children → success
  - Test: Delete Theme child → success (does not affect parent)
  - Test: Delete all children, then parent → success

Component tasks can run in parallel (different files):

```bash
# Launch T034-T038 together (5 component tasks)
# Create client/src/components/communities/GroupHierarchy.tsx
# Create client/src/components/communities/StageUpgradeButton.tsx
# Create client/src/components/communities/CreateChildTheme.tsx
# Create client/src/components/communities/ParentLink.tsx
# Create client/src/components/moderation/InheritedModeration.tsx
# (Execute in parallel using separate Task agents)
```

### Integration Tests (Phase 3.12)
Integration tests can run in parallel (different test files):

```bash
# Launch T043-T047 together (5 integration tests)
pnpm --filter server exec vitest run tests/integration/hierarchy/create-child-flow.test.ts &
pnpm --filter server exec vitest run tests/integration/hierarchy/stage-progression-flow.test.ts &
pnpm --filter server exec vitest run tests/integration/hierarchy/moderation-inheritance-flow.test.ts &
pnpm --filter server exec vitest run tests/integration/hierarchy/deletion-blocking-flow.test.ts &
pnpm --filter server exec vitest run tests/integration/hierarchy/feed-aggregation-flow.test.ts &
wait
```

## Notes

- **[P] Marker**: Tasks marked with [P] can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **TDD Enforcement**: Contract tests (T006-T011) MUST be written and failing before implementation begins
- **Constitution Compliance**:
  - Principle 8: All persistent storage uses PDS + Lexicon schemas (no separate databases)
  - Principle 10: Complete implementation (no MVP deferrals, no "Phase 2" placeholders)
  - Principle 7: Biome linting, formatting, and TypeScript type checking enforced
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after completing each task (atomic changes)
- **Error Handling**: All API endpoints must implement full error handling (400, 403, 404, 409 errors)
- **Validation**: All input validation uses Zod schemas (runtime type safety)

---

## Completion Criteria (Constitution Principle 10)

Each task MUST be fully completed before being marked as done:

✅ **Required for Completion**:
- All functionality specified in task description implemented (not partial/MVP)
- All error handling paths implemented (400, 403, 404, 409 responses)
- All validation logic implemented (Zod schemas, stage rules, Dunbar thresholds)
- All UI components created and integrated (no placeholders)
- All API endpoints implemented and tested (no mocked responses)
- Integration tests passing for completed tasks

❌ **Prohibited Patterns**:
- "MVP implementation - full version in Phase 2"
- "TODO: Complete this functionality later"
- "Placeholder UI - design pending"
- Marking task complete while tests are skipped/mocked
- Using `@ts-ignore` or `any` types to bypass validation

✅ **Acceptable Deferrals** (must be tracked as separate tasks):
- Performance optimizations beyond <200ms p95 target
- Non-critical edge cases (documented in task notes)
- Features explicitly scoped out of spec.md

## Validation Checklist

Before marking tasks.md as complete, verify:

- [x] All 6 contract endpoints have corresponding tests (T006-T011)
- [x] All 3 entities (Group, Membership, Stage) have schema tasks (T012-T014)
- [x] All 6 PDS methods have implementation tasks (T015-T020)
- [x] All 6 API endpoints have handler tasks (T026-T031)
- [x] All 5 frontend components have creation tasks (T034-T038)
- [x] All 5 integration test scenarios have test tasks (T043-T047)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before Phase 3.3+)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files, no shared state)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Constitution Principle 8 verified (PDS-first, no new databases)
- [x] Constitution Principle 10 verified (complete implementation, no MVP deferrals)
