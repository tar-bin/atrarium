## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: When owner account is deleted or becomes invalid, should system auto-transfer to next moderator or archive after warnings? ‚Üí A: Auto-transfer ownership to next moderator (if exists), else archive community
- Q: When post matches multiple theme feeds (via hashtag filtering), should it appear in all or first match only? ‚Üí A: Not applicable - users post directly to specific theme feeds, not filtered from global Bluesky
- Q: When user deletes post, should feeds reflect deletion immediately or maintain cached reference? ‚Üí A: Deletions reflected eventually via best-effort sync (not real-time guarantee)
- Q: Is there a maximum number of communities one user can join? ‚Üí A: No limit (unlimited memberships)
- Q: If AT Protocol connection drops during posting, what is acceptable failure behavior? ‚Üí A: Fail immediately and show error to user (manual retry required)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A small community administrator (previously running a Mastodon/Misskey server) wants to reduce operational costs and burden while maintaining a connected, discoverable community for 10-200 members. They need to create a community space, configure content filtering by themes, allow members to join, and display relevant posts from both their community and the broader Bluesky network.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an administrator wants to start a new community, **When** they provide a name, description, and optional parent community, **Then** the system creates a community space and assigns them as owner.

2. **Given** a community owner wants to organize content by themes, **When** they create a theme feed with hashtags and keywords (e.g., #React, #WebDev), **Then** the system filters and displays matching posts from the Bluesky network.

3. **Given** a user wants to join a community, **When** they authenticate with their AT Protocol identity (DID), **Then** the system grants membership and allows them to view community feeds.

4. **Given** a community has grown beyond comfortable size (150+ active members), **When** the owner reviews growth metrics, **Then** the system suggests splitting into smaller themed communities or graduating to independence.

5. **Given** a community owner wants to maintain connection with the broader network, **When** they configure feed composition ratios, **Then** the system displays mixed content (e.g., 80% own community, 15% parent community, 5% global Bluesky).

6. **Given** a theme feed receives no posts for 7 days, **When** the system detects inactivity, **Then** it changes status to "warning" and notifies the owner.

7. **Given** a theme feed remains inactive for 14 days, **When** the system confirms continued low activity, **Then** it archives the feed automatically.

### Edge Cases

- When the community owner's account is deleted or becomes invalid, the system automatically transfers ownership to the next moderator (by seniority/join date). If no moderators exist, the community archives automatically.
- When a user deletes their post, the system removes it from feeds via best-effort synchronization (eventual consistency, not real-time guarantee).
- Users can join unlimited number of communities (no membership limit enforced).
- When AT Protocol connection fails during posting, the system shows an error message to the user and requires manual retry (no automatic retry or queuing).
- How does the system handle posts in languages other than English/Japanese? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Language filtering requirements not specified - deferred to planning phase]

- **FR-039**: Communities MUST be discoverable via Bluesky clients using standard feed URIs

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Community**: Represents a group space with members, configuration, and lineage. Key attributes include unique identifier, name, description, stage (theme/community/graduated), parent reference, feed composition ratios, member count, post count, creation and graduation timestamps.

- **Theme Feed**: Represents a discussion channel within a community where users can post directly. Key attributes include unique identifier, parent community, name, description, status (active/warning/archived), health metrics (last post time, activity counts), creation and archival timestamps.

- **Membership**: Represents a user's association with a community. Key attributes include community identifier, user DID (AT Protocol identity), role (member/moderator/owner), join timestamp, last activity timestamp. Uses composite key of community + user DID.

- **Post Index**: Represents a reference to a post made to a theme feed. Key attributes include post URI (AT Protocol reference format), target theme feed identifier, author DID, creation timestamp, media presence flag. Does NOT contain full post content.

- **Achievement**: Represents gamification rewards for user actions. Key attributes include user DID, achievement identifier (e.g., "first_join", "first_split"), associated community, unlock timestamp. Achievements celebrate all lifecycle choices (creation, growth, merging, closure).

- **Owner Transition Log**: Tracks ownership changes for accountability. Key attributes include community identifier, previous owner DID, new owner DID, reason for transfer (deletion/inactivity/vacation/manual), transition timestamp.

4. ~~**Membership limits**: Is there a maximum number of communities one user can join?~~ **RESOLVED**: No limit (unlimited memberships).
5. ~~**Connection failure**: If AT Protocol connection drops during posting, what is acceptable failure behavior?~~ **RESOLVED**: Fail immediately with error message (manual retry).
6. **Language support**: Should system filter or tag posts by language? What languages are supported? **DEFERRED**: Low impact for MVP, better addressed in planning phase.

## Notes for Planning Phase

This specification captures the WHAT of the Atrarium MVP system. Key differentiators:
- **Cost reduction**: 95% cheaper than traditional Mastodon/Misskey ($5/month vs $30-150/month)
- **Burden reduction**: 80% less operational time (serverless, no server management)
- **Network effect**: Leverages Bluesky's 30M+ user base for discoverability
- **Dynamic sizing**: Built-in lifecycle to keep communities "just right" size
- **Data ownership**: Users own their data via AT Protocol, system only indexes

Phase 0 scope deliberately minimal: basic feed generation, simple filtering, community creation. Deferred to later phases: achievements, advanced moderation, analytics, community discovery features.
