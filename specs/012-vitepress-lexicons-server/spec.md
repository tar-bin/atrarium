# Feature Specification: Remove VitePress Hosting and Reorganize Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `012-vitepress-lexicons-server`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "vitepress„ÅÆ„Éõ„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„É≥„Ç∞„ÅØ„ÅÇ„Åæ„ÇäÊÑèÂë≥„Åå„Å™„Åï„Åù„ÅÜ„Å™„ÅÆ„ÅßÂâäÈô§„ÄÇ„Éâ„Ç≠„É•„É°„É≥„ÉàÈ°û„ÅØlexicons, server, client„Å™„Å©ÂØæÂøú„Åô„Çã„Éá„Ç£„É¨„ÇØ„Éà„É™ÈÖç‰∏ã„Å´Êï¥ÁêÜ„Åó„Å¶‰øùÂ≠ò„ÄÇ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Remove VitePress hosting, reorganize docs to component directories
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Project maintainers, developers
   ‚Üí Actions: Remove VitePress workspace, move documentation files, update references
   ‚Üí Data: Documentation files (*.md), VitePress config, deployment configs
   ‚Üí Constraints: Preserve documentation content, maintain accessibility
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí docs.atrarium.net deployment will be completely removed (Cloudflare Pages configuration)
   ‚Üí Japanese translations (ja/) will be removed, keep English only
   ‚Üí Cross-component references will use absolute paths from repo root (e.g., /server/docs/api.md)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer accesses component-specific documentation locally
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable via file structure checks
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Documentation files, workspace configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: docs.atrarium.net deployment handling? ‚Üí A: A (Complete removal including Cloudflare Pages configuration)
- Q: i18n documentation files (ja/) handling? ‚Üí A: A (Keep English only, remove ja/ translations)
- Q: Cross-component documentation reference link format? ‚Üí A: C (Absolute paths from repository root, e.g., /server/docs/api.md)
- Q: VitePress-specific assets (images, diagrams) handling? ‚Üí A: A (Delete assets and remove image references from documentation)
- Q: Documentation placement granularity within component directories? ‚Üí A: C (Multiple topic-based markdown files at component root, e.g., server/API.md, server/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Q: Documentation consolidation approach? ‚Üí A: Consolidate redundant/overlapping documentation during migration (not just move)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on a specific component (lexicons, server, or client), I want to access relevant, consolidated documentation as topic-based markdown files directly at the component's root directory (e.g., server/API.md, server/ARCHITECTURE.md), so that I can find component-specific documentation without navigating to a separate documentation site, subdirectory, or multiple overlapping files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** VitePress workspace exists, **When** removal is executed, **Then** VitePress workspace is completely removed from pnpm workspaces
2. **Given** documentation exists in `docs/` directory, **When** reorganization is executed, **Then** documentation files are moved to respective component directories (lexicons/, server/, client/)
3. **Given** documentation has been reorganized, **When** developer navigates to component directory, **Then** topic-based markdown files are present at component root level (not in docs/ subdirectory)
4. **Given** documentation references exist in README.md, **When** reorganization is complete, **Then** references are updated to point to new locations

### Edge Cases
- What happens to VitePress-specific assets (images, diagrams)? (Delete assets and remove image references from documentation)
- How are cross-component documentation references updated? (Use absolute paths from repository root, e.g., /server/docs/api.md)
- What happens to i18n documentation files (en/, ja/)? (Keep English only, remove Japanese translations)
- How is the existing deployment at docs.atrarium.net handled? (Cloudflare Pages configuration will be completely removed)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove VitePress workspace from pnpm workspace configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove VitePress-related package.json dependencies and scripts
- **FR-003**: System MUST move lexicon-related documentation to lexicons/ directory as topic-based markdown files at root level
- **FR-004**: System MUST move server-related documentation to server/ directory as topic-based markdown files at root level
- **FR-005**: System MUST move client-related documentation to client/ directory as topic-based markdown files at root level
- **FR-006**: System MUST consolidate redundant or overlapping documentation during migration while preserving essential content
- **FR-007**: System MUST update README.md references to reflect new documentation locations
- **FR-008**: System MUST update CLAUDE.md references to reflect new documentation structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST completely remove VitePress deployment at docs.atrarium.net including Cloudflare Pages configuration
- **FR-010**: System MUST keep English documentation only and remove Japanese translations (ja/ directories)
- **FR-011**: System MUST update cross-component documentation references to use absolute paths from repository root (e.g., /server/docs/api.md)
- **FR-012**: System MUST remove VitePress-specific assets (images, diagrams in .vitepress/ and public/ directories) and remove image references from documentation
- **FR-013**: System MUST place documentation as topic-based markdown files at component root level (e.g., server/API.md, client/DEPLOYMENT.md), not in docs/ subdirectories
- **FR-014**: System MUST identify and merge duplicate documentation sections across multiple files
- **FR-015**: System MUST remove outdated or VitePress-specific documentation that no longer applies

### Key Entities
- **VitePress Workspace**: The `docs/` directory containing VitePress configuration, documentation pages, and deployment settings
- **Component Documentation**: Markdown files specific to lexicons, server, or client components
- **Workspace Configuration**: pnpm-workspace.yaml and root package.json referencing the docs workspace
- **Documentation References**: Links in README.md, CLAUDE.md, and other files pointing to VitePress documentation
