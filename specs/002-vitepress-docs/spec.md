   ‚Üí Actions: read documentation, navigate between docs, search content
   ‚Üí Data: existing markdown docs in docs/ directory
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain existing documentation structure
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Deployment target - Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, or other?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should existing docs/ structure be reorganized or kept as-is?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-language support requirements - English only or include Japanese?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Defined below
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Documentation pages, navigation structure, search index
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - see NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: Deployment Platform - Where should the documentation site be deployed? ‚Üí A: Cloudflare Pages
- Q: Multi-language Support - Should the documentation site support both English and Japanese, or English only? ‚Üí A: English + Japanese
- Q: Auto-deployment - Should documentation rebuild automatically on every commit to main, or require manual trigger? ‚Üí A: Every commit to main (using Cloudflare Pages automatic deployment)
- Q: Custom Domain - Is a custom domain required (e.g., docs.atrarium.dev), or is the default platform domain sufficient? ‚Üí A: Optional/Future (start with default, support custom domain later)
- Q: Performance Target - What is the acceptable page load time? ‚Üí A: No specific numeric target, subjectively comfortable user experience is sufficient
- Q: Documentation Structure - Should we keep the existing docs/ structure as-is, or reorganize for better user experience? ‚Üí A: Reorganize for better UX (deferred to planning phase)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or contributor, I want to access comprehensive project documentation through a well-organized documentation site so that I can understand the project architecture, setup instructions, API references, and contribution guidelines without having to search through multiple markdown files in the repository.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a new developer exploring the project, **When** I visit the documentation site, **Then** I should see a clear navigation structure with sections for overview, setup, API reference, and guides

2. **Given** I am reading the project overview, **When** I need to find information about the database schema, **Then** I should be able to navigate to the system design documentation through clear links or navigation menu

3. **Given** I am searching for specific information, **When** I use the documentation search feature, **Then** I should get relevant results from all documentation pages

4. **Given** I am viewing documentation on mobile, **When** I access any documentation page, **Then** the content should be readable and navigation should be accessible

5. **Given** existing documentation files are in docs/ directory, **When** the documentation site is built, **Then** all existing content should be available and properly organized

6. **Given** I am a contributor wanting to update documentation, **When** I edit markdown files, **Then** changes should be reflected in the documentation site after build/deployment

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a documentation page links to a non-existent page?
- How does the system handle documentation files with different markdown flavors?
- What happens when documentation images or assets are missing?
- How are code examples rendered if they contain syntax errors?
- What happens when documentation is accessed on very old browsers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Content Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate all existing documentation from docs/ directory to the documentation site
- **FR-002**: System SHOULD reorganize documentation structure for better user experience while preserving all content
- **FR-003**: System MUST support markdown formatting including code blocks, tables, and images
- **FR-004**: System MUST render links between documentation pages correctly
- **FR-005**: System MUST display documentation in both English and Japanese with language switcher
- **FR-005a**: System MUST maintain separate content for English (en/) and Japanese (ja/) versions
- **FR-005b**: System MUST preserve user's language preference across page navigation

#### Navigation & Discovery
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a sidebar navigation menu showing all documentation sections
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide breadcrumb navigation showing current page location
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide search functionality across all documentation content
- **FR-009**: System MUST highlight current page in navigation menu
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide "previous/next page" navigation at bottom of each page

#### User Experience
- **FR-011**: System MUST be responsive and work on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide dark/light theme toggle
- **FR-013**: System MUST support syntax highlighting for code examples in multiple languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, bash)
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide table of contents for long documentation pages
- **FR-015**: System MUST render with comfortable performance for typical documentation browsing (no specific numeric target)

#### Deployment & Access
- **FR-016**: System MUST be deployed to Cloudflare Pages

- **FR-018**: System MUST automatically rebuild and deploy when commits are pushed to main branch using Cloudflare Pages automatic deployment
- **FR-019**: System MUST serve documentation over HTTPS
- **FR-020**: System SHOULD support custom domain configuration (e.g., docs.atrarium.dev) as a future enhancement

#### Content Organization
- **FR-021**: System MUST include the following documentation sections:
  - Project Overview (from docs/01-overview.md)
  - System Design (from docs/02-system-design.md)
  - Implementation Guide (from docs/03-implementation.md)
  - API Reference (from docs/api-reference.md)
  - Market Research (from docs/market-research.md)
- **FR-022**: System MUST link to README.md and CLAUDE.md in the main repository
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide a "Edit this page" link to GitHub for each documentation page

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Search Index**: Indexed content enabling full-text search across all documentation
- **Theme Configuration**: User preference for light/dark mode, persisted across sessions
- **Table of Contents**: Auto-generated heading hierarchy for each page enabling quick navigation within a document

## Questions for Clarification

Before proceeding to implementation planning, please clarify:

1. **Deployment Platform**: Where should the documentation site be deployed? (Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, or other?)

2. **Documentation Structure**: Should we keep the existing docs/ structure as-is, or reorganize for better user experience?

3. **Multi-language Support**: Should the documentation site support both English and Japanese, or English only for now?

4. **Auto-deployment**: Should documentation rebuild automatically on every commit to main, or require manual trigger?

5. **Custom Domain**: Is a custom domain required (e.g., docs.atrarium.dev), or is the default platform domain sufficient?

6. **Performance Target**: What is the acceptable page load time? (e.g., <3 seconds for initial load)
