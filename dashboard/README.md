# Atrarium Dashboard

Web-based management interface for Atrarium communities, feeds, and moderation built with React, TanStack Router, and TanStack Query.

## Overview

The Atrarium Dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to:
- Manage communities and theme feeds (PDS-first architecture)
- Authenticate via Bluesky PDS (AtpAgent integration)
- Post content to feeds with automatic hashtag inclusion
- Monitor and moderate community activity
- View moderation logs and statistics

**Current Status**: Phase 1 Complete (PDS-first architecture, production-ready frontend)

## Tech Stack

**Frontend Framework:**
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- TanStack Router v1 (file-based routing)
- TanStack Query v5 (server state management)
- TanStack Table v8 (data tables)

**UI Components:**
- shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
- lucide-react icons
- react-hook-form + Zod validation

**Backend Integration:**
- oRPC for type-safe API calls (Hono backend on Cloudflare Workers)
- @atproto/api v0.13.35+ with AtpAgent (PDS read/write operations)
- PDS-first architecture (all data stored in user PDSs via AT Protocol Lexicon)
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for testing

**Testing:**
- Vitest with @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers
- Testing Library for component tests

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Atrarium backend running (Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects)
- Bluesky PDS account (for authentication and posting)
  - Local PDS instance for development (see DevContainer setup)
  - Or production Bluesky account (bsky.social)

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to dashboard directory
cd dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.development` and `.env.production` files (see `.env.example`):

```env
# Backend API URL (Cloudflare Workers)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787

# PDS URL (for authentication and posting)
# Development: Local PDS instance
VITE_PDS_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Production: Bluesky PDS
# VITE_PDS_URL=https://bsky.social
```

### Load Test Data (Development)

**Note**: Test data loading is currently for D1 development environment. In PDS-first architecture, community and membership data is stored in user PDSs.

For local development with D1 (before full PDS migration):

```bash
# From the root directory
./scripts/load-test-data.sh
```

This creates:
- 5 test communities (anime, tech, games, manga, web3)
- 9 theme feeds with hashtags (#atr_xxxxxxxx format)
- 20 sample posts
- 17 user memberships

See [../seeds/README.md](../seeds/README.md) for details on test users and data.

**PDS-first architecture**: In production, data is created via PDS write operations (see [../docs/en/architecture/database.md](../docs/en/architecture/database.md)).

## Development

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173`

**Note for DevContainer users**: Hot module replacement (HMR) uses polling to detect file changes. If you notice that changes aren't being reflected automatically:
1. Save the file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)
2. Wait 1-2 seconds for the polling interval
3. The browser should auto-reload

The polling interval is set to 1000ms (1 second) in `vite.config.ts`.

### Generate Route Tree

TanStack Router uses file-based routing with auto-generated route tree:

```bash
npx tsr generate
```

This is automatically run on file changes during `npm run dev`.

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# TypeScript type checking (no emit)
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Build & Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs to `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

**Automatic Deployment (Recommended):**

1. Connect GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages
2. Set build settings:
   - **Build command**: `cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `dashboard/dist`
   - **Root directory**: leave empty (repo root)
3. Set environment variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: Your production backend URL
   - `VITE_PDS_URL`: Your production PDS URL (if applicable)

**Manual Deployment:**

```bash
# Build first
npm run build

# Deploy with Wrangler
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=atrarium-dashboard
```

## Usage

### Login to PDS

1. Navigate to home page (`/`)
2. If not authenticated, PDS login form appears
3. Enter handle (e.g., `alice.test` for local PDS, or `your-handle.bsky.social` for production)
4. Enter app password (PDS credentials)
5. Session persists in localStorage via PDSContext
6. AtpAgent authenticates with PDS and manages session

**Authentication Flow**:
- Dashboard → AtpAgent → PDS (bsky.social or local)
- JWT token stored in localStorage
- Automatic session restoration on page reload

### Create Community (PDS-First)

**Current Implementation** (Hybrid - transitioning to PDS-first):

1. Navigate to Communities (`/communities`)
2. Click "Create Community" button
3. Fill in name and description
4. Backend creates:
   - **PDS record**: `net.atrarium.community.config` in owner's PDS
   - **Durable Object**: `CommunityFeedGenerator` instance
5. Community appears in list

**Data Flow**:
```
Dashboard → Workers API → ATProtoService.createCommunityConfig()
         → PDS (AT-URI: at://did:plc:owner/net.atrarium.community.config/rkey)
         → Durable Object initialization
```

### Create Feed (PDS-First)

1. Navigate to community detail page (`/communities/:id`)
2. Click "Create Feed" button
3. Fill in name and description
4. System generates unique hashtag (e.g., `#atr_a1b2c3d4` - 8-char hex)
5. Backend creates:
   - **Feed config** in Durable Objects Storage
   - **Hashtag association** for post filtering
6. Copy hashtag for posting

**Hashtag Format**: `#atr_[0-9a-f]{8}` (system-generated, unique per feed)

### Post to Feed (via PDS)

1. Navigate to feed detail page (`/communities/:id/feeds/:feedId`)
2. Enter post text in form
3. System automatically appends feed hashtag
4. Submit post via AtpAgent → PDS
5. Post published to your PDS with hashtag
6. Firehose picks up post → Queue → FirehoseProcessor → CommunityFeedGenerator DO
7. Post appears in feed after indexing (~1-2 seconds)

**Data Flow**:
```
Dashboard → AtpAgent.post({ text: "Content #atr_xxxxxxxx" })
         → PDS (at://did:plc:user/app.bsky.feed.post/rkey)
         → Bluesky Firehose (Jetstream WebSocket)
         → FirehoseReceiver DO (lightweight filter)
         → Cloudflare Queue (batched)
         → FirehoseProcessor Worker (heavyweight regex filter)
         → CommunityFeedGenerator DO (Durable Objects Storage)
         → getFeedSkeleton API (returns post URIs)
```

### Moderate Content

**Moderation Actions** (PDS-First):

1. Navigate to feed detail page (as moderator/owner)
2. Click "Hide" button on a post
3. Confirm action in dialog
4. Backend creates:
   - **PDS record**: `net.atrarium.moderation.action` in moderator's PDS
   - **Durable Object update**: Post marked as `hidden` in Storage
5. Post is hidden from public view
6. View moderation log at `/moderation`

**Supported Actions**:
- Hide post (`hide_post`)
- Unhide post (`unhide_post`)
- Block user (`block_user`)
- Unblock user (`unblock_user`)

**Data Flow**:
```
Dashboard → Workers API → ATProtoService.createModerationAction()
         → PDS (at://did:plc:moderator/net.atrarium.moderation.action/rkey)
         → Firehose → CommunityFeedGenerator DO (update moderation status)
         → getFeedSkeleton excludes hidden posts
```

## Testing Strategy

**Component Tests (TDD):**
- Written before implementation (Phase 3.3)
- Test rendering, user interactions, validation
- Use Testing Library + Vitest
- Located in `tests/components/`

**Integration Tests:**
- Test end-to-end user flows
- Use MSW to mock backend API
- Located in `tests/integration/`

**MSW Mocking:**
- Mock handlers in `tests/mocks/handlers.ts`
- Intercept API calls during tests
- No real backend required

## Features Implemented

**Phase 1 Complete** (PDS-first architecture):
- ✅ PDS authentication via AtpAgent
- ✅ Community management UI (create, list, view)
- ✅ Feed management UI (create, list, view with hashtags)
- ✅ Post creation with automatic hashtag inclusion
- ✅ Moderation UI (hide posts, moderation log)
- ✅ PDS session management (localStorage persistence)
- ✅ i18n support (EN/JA translations)
- ✅ Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Component tests (TDD)
- ✅ Production build (<500KB gzip)

**Architecture Highlights**:
- PDS-first data flow (all writes go to user PDSs)
- AtpAgent for PDS operations (@atproto/api v0.13.35+)
- Durable Objects Storage for 7-day feed cache
- Cloudflare Queues for Firehose processing
- Two-stage filtering (lightweight + heavyweight)

**Pending Features**:
- ⏳ Dashboard API integration (currently placeholder client)
- ⏳ Real-time feed updates (WebSocket from Firehose)
- ⏳ Production deployment to Cloudflare Pages

## Troubleshooting

### Route tree generation fails

Run from dashboard directory:
```bash
cd dashboard
npx tsr generate
```

### Tests hang or timeout

MSW interceptor setup may be slow. Check `tests/setup.ts` configuration.

### Types not recognized

Ensure `@/` path alias is configured in `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`.

### PDS connection fails

Verify `VITE_PDS_URL` is set correctly and PDS is running.

**Common PDS issues**:
- Local PDS: Ensure DevContainer is running (`docker ps` should show `pds` container)
- Production PDS: Use `https://bsky.social` (not `http://`)
- App password: Generate app password at Bluesky settings (not your main password)

### Backend API connection fails

Verify `VITE_API_URL` points to running Workers instance:
- Development: `http://localhost:8787` (run `npm run dev` in root directory)
- Production: Your deployed Workers URL (e.g., `https://atrarium.workers.dev`)

### Hashtag not recognized in feed

- Ensure hashtag format is `#atr_[0-9a-f]{8}` (8-character hex)
- Check that post was published to PDS successfully
- Wait 1-2 seconds for Firehose indexing
- Verify FirehoseProcessor is running (check Workers logs)
