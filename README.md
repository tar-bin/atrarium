# Atrarium

**Small ecosystems on AT Protocol**

English | [Êó•Êú¨Ë™û](./README.ja.md)

Atrarium is a community management system built on the AT Protocol, designed to help small community managers (10-200 people) run sustainable, thriving communities without the operational burden of traditional federated servers.

## üéØ What is Atrarium?

Atrarium liberates small community managers from the heavy operational costs and technical complexity of running Mastodon/Misskey servers, while preserving community independence.

### Key Features

- üå± **Zero Server Management**: Built on Cloudflare's serverless infrastructure
- üí∞ **95% Cost Reduction**: From $30-150/month to just $5/month
- ‚è±Ô∏è **80% Time Savings**: From 5 hours/week to 1 hour/week
- üîì **True Data Ownership**: Users own their data via DIDs
- üåê **Natural Discovery**: Connect with Bluesky's 30M+ users
- ü§ñ **Automated Growth**: Smart community lifecycle management

## üö® The Problem We Solve

### Fediverse Small Server Crisis

Small Mastodon/Misskey servers (10-200 people) face critical challenges:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **High operational costs** | $30-150/month + 5 hours/week |
| **Isolation and decline** | 50-70% close within 1-2 years |
| **Federation risks** | Can be cut off by large servers anytime |
| **Technical complexity** | DB corruption, SSL, updates, etc. |
| **Legal liability** | Individual operators bear all responsibility |

**Market Size**: 450-800 small instances in Japanese-speaking Fediverse, with 75,000-200,000 users

---

## üí° How Atrarium Solves This

### Built on AT Protocol

Atrarium leverages AT Protocol's design to fundamentally solve these problems:

1. **Shared Infrastructure**: Cloudflare's stable platform eliminates server management
2. **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Accounts are independent from servers, zero migration cost
3. **Custom Feeds**: Flexible community design without heavy implementation
4. **Bluesky Network**: Connect with 30M+ users for natural discovery

### Cost Comparison

| | Fediverse | Atrarium | Savings |
|---|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Monthly** | $30-150 | **$0.40-5** | **92-99%** |
| **Annually** | $360-1,800 | **$5-60** | **92-99%** |
| **Weekly Time** | 5 hours | **1 hour** | **80%** |

*Note: $0.40/month for 1000 communities (Durable Objects + Queues only), $5/month includes Workers Paid plan*

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture (PDS-First)

```
PDS (Source of Truth)
  ‚Üì Firehose: Jetstream WebSocket
FirehoseReceiver (Durable Object)
  ‚Üì Lightweight filter: includes('#atr_')
Cloudflare Queue
  ‚Üì Batched: 100 msg/batch
FirehoseProcessor (Queue Consumer Worker)
  ‚Üì Heavyweight filter: regex /#atr_[0-9a-f]{8}/
CommunityFeedGenerator (Durable Object per community)
  ‚Üì Storage: config:, member:, post:, moderation:
Feed Generator API (getFeedSkeleton)
  ‚Üì
Client (Bluesky AppView fetches post content)
```

**Key Principles**:
- **PDS as Source of Truth**: All community data stored in user PDSs via AT Protocol Lexicon
- **Durable Objects Storage**: Per-community feed index with 7-day retention
- **Queue-Based Processing**: Two-stage filtering for efficient Firehose ingestion
- **Zero Database Costs**: No D1/KV, only Durable Objects Storage (~$0.40/month for 1000 communities)

### Tech Stack

**Backend (Implemented)**:
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless edge computing with Hono framework
- **Durable Objects**: Per-community feed generators with persistent Storage API
- **Cloudflare Queues**: Firehose event processing (5000 msg/sec capacity)
- **AT Protocol**: `@atproto/api` (AtpAgent), `@atproto/identity`
- **TypeScript 5.7**: Strict type safety with Zod validation
- **Vitest**: Testing with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`

**Frontend (Implemented)**:
- **React 19 + TypeScript**: Management dashboard with modern React
- **TanStack Router**: File-based routing with type-safe params
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management with caching
- **shadcn/ui**: Accessible UI components (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
- **Vite**: Fast build tooling and HMR
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Dashboard hosting (free)

**External Services**:
- **AT Protocol**: `@atproto/api` (AtpAgent), `@atproto/identity`
- **Bluesky Firehose**: Jetstream WebSocket (real-time event streaming)
- **Local PDS**: DevContainer integration for testing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Cloudflare account (Workers Paid plan - $5/month)
- Bluesky account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tar-bin/atrarium.git
cd atrarium

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Wrangler CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login

# Create Cloudflare Queues (for Firehose processing)
wrangler queues create firehose-events
wrangler queues create firehose-dlq  # Dead letter queue

# Durable Objects are automatically provisioned on first deploy
# No database setup required (PDS-first architecture)

# Set secrets (for production deployment)
wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
wrangler secret put BLUESKY_HANDLE         # For PDS write operations
wrangler secret put BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD   # For PDS write operations
```

### Development

```bash
# Run Workers locally (with Miniflare)
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Code quality
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers (includes Durable Objects + Queues)
npm run deploy

# View production logs
wrangler tail --format pretty

# Monitor Durable Objects
wrangler tail --format json | grep "CommunityFeedGenerator"

# Monitor Queue processing
wrangler tail --format json | grep "FirehoseProcessor"
```

### Dashboard Setup

The Atrarium Dashboard provides a web interface for managing communities, feeds, and moderation.

```bash
# Navigate to dashboard directory
cd dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.development

# Edit .env.development with your configuration
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787
# VITE_PDS_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Start dashboard dev server
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173
```

**Dashboard Features:**
- üèòÔ∏è Community management (create, view, settings)
- üì° Feed management with unique hashtags
- ‚úçÔ∏è Post to feeds via local Bluesky PDS
- üõ°Ô∏è Content moderation (hide posts, block users)
- üìä Moderation log and statistics
- üåê i18n support (English/Japanese)

For detailed dashboard documentation, see [dashboard/README.md](./dashboard/README.md).

### Testing with Local PDS

Atrarium uses a DevContainer with a local Bluesky PDS for testing:

```bash
# Open project in VS Code DevContainer
# PDS automatically starts at http://localhost:3000

# Setup test accounts
.devcontainer/setup-pds.sh

# Run PDS integration tests
npx vitest run tests/integration/pds-posting.test.ts
npx vitest run tests/integration/pds-to-feed-flow.test.ts
```

**Test data** is created dynamically via PDS write operations (no SQL seeds needed).

## üéØ Use Cases

### Case 1: Migrating from Misskey

**Before:**
- 20-person programming community
- $45/month server costs
- 5 hours/week maintenance
- Fear of decline

**After:**
- $0.40-5/month stable operation (scale-dependent)
- < 1 hour/week management
- Discovery via Bluesky users
- Flexible DID-based migration

**Savings:** $475-1,740/year + 208 hours/year

### Case 2: Starting a New Community

**Traditional Challenges:**
- Technical barriers (Mastodon/Misskey setup)
- Difficulty acquiring initial members
- Operational cost concerns

**With Atrarium:**
- Zero technical barriers (Custom Feed creation only)
- Natural inflow from Bluesky
- Start with $0.40/month (scales to $5/month with Workers Paid)
- Gradual feature expansion as you grow

### Case 3: Small Community Ecosystem

**Value:**
- Multiple small communities interconnect
- Share moderation knowledge
- Distribute infrastructure costs
- Independent yet not isolated
